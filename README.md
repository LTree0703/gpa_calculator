# Pass 3 Exceed 4 GPA Calculator

A mobile GPA calculator app based on flutter.

## Introduction

This app was inspired by the online GPA Calculator. Since it was only available on the internet, I decided to make a mobile version of it with optimized user experience. 
- This app consists of two calculators: GPA and Grade calculator.

1. GPA calculator: Calculate your semester and cumulative GPA based on the grades of your courses.
2. Grade Calculator: Predict the overall grade of your course based on the components of the course assessments. (This may, however, subject to the curve of every course and the decision of course instructors and may differ among each course)
